# Laravel Basics

Every Video in the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzma7qHnAfI&list=PL2DahmvUpeutUtHy8OvaytrxQhM8qbtaN) has its own branch. The master branch always contains the latest code.

If you want to look at the code of the ["Laravel 8 - Validation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34tBHVVgXt0) video, then checkout to that branch specific for that video and you will be able to see all the codes there. E.g.
```sh
git checkout validation
```
